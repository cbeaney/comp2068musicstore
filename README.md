BBC Music Store!
 
Team Members:
Ben 
Barry 
Charlie

This project was a collaborative effort from all memebers using the VSCode extention Live Share. Each member had a hand in either creating/modifying each component within the application and a massive collaboration with finding/fixing errors or typos. Souly Charlie had built the bases for this application getting the root components in place, Barry helped along side Charlie to implement authenticaion and all of the CSS. Ben stepped in to fix the login and authenticating users with proper redirects. He also implemented controller elements to have all routes working properly. Once that was completed the actual music store was a team effort of constant back and forth fixes/additions to have working CRUD operations. Ben added some console.log(err) lines to some portions of code that were acting up and not properly displaying flash errors to the screen. After all bugs were squished Barry implemented the last few CSS additions and Charlie pushed to Github then deploying to Heroku.
